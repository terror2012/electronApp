Install node, last version https://nodejs.dev/
Go to package.json and replace RepositoryURL with your github repo URL
Go to electron-builder.yml and replace YourPersonalTokenHere with your github personal token
Open a terminal and cd into the project folder.
Run npm install
After that, you can build your first version with the following command
electron-builder build --win -p="always" -c="electron-builder.yml"
The above command builds only for windows, to add linux as well, add --linux , and 
for all 3 OSs, run the following command
electron-builder build -mwl -p="always" -c="electron-builder.yml"

For every update, you'd have to increment the version from package.json, from 1.0.0. 
Any incrementation will be considered a new version
Once that's done, you'll have a new tab in your repo called releases, where you will 
have a draft of your application. Just press edit and then save, this will move it 
from draft to release and thus be available to be updated next time an user starts 
the application

PS: You can set your repository to private, so the code/releases will be normally hidden, but
the application will still be able
